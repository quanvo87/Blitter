# Blitter - A Social Networking App Demo

An demonstration that uses the [Kitura web framework](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura) to produce a feed of posts that people can follow.

## Requires:

 - [XCode 8](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
 - [Cassandra 3.4+](http://cassandra.apache.org/) or [ScyllaDB](http://www.scylladb.com/)

## Quick start:

 You can build and run this demo on multiple platforms, such as XCode, macOS Terminal, Linux terminal, or a docker container. The quick start steps vary by how you intend to build the target.

1. Install Cassandra or ScyllaDB:

 On Linux, you can download the latest package from the website. If on macOS, you can install it with Homebrew:

 `brew install cassandra`

2. Set up the schemas with the blitter.sql file:

 CQLsh is in the /bin directory of your Cassandra/ScyllaDB installation.

 `cqlsh -f blitter.sql`

3. Install OpenSSL with:

 `brew install openssl`
  
### Generate an XCode project:

You can use XCode to edit, build, test, and debug your code. To generate an XCode project, you can use the Swift Package Manager to generate one for you. Since we must use the OpenSSL header and library files, we must specify the search paths for these files to the generator script.

 `swift package generate-xcodeproj -Xswiftc -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -Xlinker -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib`


### Building and testing in Linux

1. Build the project

 `swift build`
  
2. Test the project

 `swift test`
